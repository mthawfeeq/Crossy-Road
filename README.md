# Crossy-Road

- Implemented the popular Arcade game Crossy Road using Python and Turtle class (where the Turtle is the chicken here, and there will be cars coming in from one direction). 
- The turtle moves using the standard UP and DOWN arrow keys and whenever the Turtle crosses to the other side of the road, it levels up and the speed of the cars start increasing to engage the user in gameplay. 
- The game ends when the Turtle hits any car.
